# Hand_Gesture_Media_Control
Developed a real-time system to control media playback using hand gestures captured via webcam.  Implemented gesture recognition with MediaPipe and OpenCV, mapped gestures (play/pause, volume control, next/previous, mute, speed adjustment) to keyboard shortcuts using pynput.
